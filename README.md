# Rubab

A web music player built with VueJS and inspired by Spotify. The name is taken from an Afghan instrument 'Rubab'. I created this projects 10 years ago when I was learning PHP. I have now decided to rewrite it with VueJS and make it open source. It is just a remastered version of the old project.
