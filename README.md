# Rubab

A web music player built with VueJS and inspired by Spotify. The name is taken from an Afghan instrument 'Rubab'. I created this project 10 years ago when I was learning PHP. Now, I have decided to rewrite it with VueJS and make it open-source. It is just a remastered version of the old project.

You can view a demo deployment [here](https://rubab.netlify.com)
